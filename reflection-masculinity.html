    <div class="paper">
      <p>In the articles about masculinity in contemporary urban Egypt, there is a clear focus on when men perform their gender role adequately versus when they do not. Transgressing prescribed gender roles in any society is usually considered strange if not morally questionable, yet the ability to effectively affirm one’s own gender identity is heavily affected by their social class. Here we examine two narratives from the past century: one of men working in textile factories during the first half of the 20th century, and the other of a man working in the auto body repair industry in the latter half of the century into the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Hammad presents a close look into the Company, a textile factory operating in al-Mahalla in Egypt, starting around the 1920s into the early 1950s. Rank-and-file workers here are severely physically punished by their supervisors to discourage tardiness and imprecise, sloppy work. Twice a month, workers numbering in the thousands received a check to cash at only a small handful of cashier’s windows; the resulting chaos encouraged guards to use brutal force to discipline the workers. This created a normalisation of violence in the factory. When bosses hit their workers, the workers would release this tension by hitting their coworkers.</p>
      <p>Workers constantly under barrage of violence were without power in their primary space, the place where they spent the most waking hours per day. This daily emasculation and loss of control and bodily autonomy meant that they had to seek out other ways of exerting power and control over their day-to-day life. Hammad describes workers exploiting the inefficient system of the Company by adding false names to the payroll, bribing officials to ignore medical checkups, etc. Meanwhile, both outside the factory as well as inside, workers engaged in passive resistance against this new, strict timekeeping system (as well as what it symbolised, capitalism and industrialisation) by purposely ignoring the clock and adapting a more relaxed, tardy mindset.</p>
      <p>The supervisors (who were sometimes physically disciplined themselves by their higher-ups) and guards were able to enact violence on their workers simply by virtue of having been given power over them. They were able to affirm their gender role and masculinity at any time, as needed. In addition, the top managers (for example Hamdi) used violence, even against fellow white-collar workers. The ability and ease at which one can affirm their masculinity, therefore, is a direct result of how high their social class is and how much power they have over others and themselves.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Ghannam presents a close look into one man’s experience in the al-Zawiya region of Cairo. Samer, an auto body repairman by trade who has been in the business since he was ten years old, was an exemplar for masculinity in his youth. He would often put the needs of others above his own, protecting women and children in distress. This was very much admired by his peers at the time, though his family criticized his carelessness and impulsiveness.</p>
      <p>As he aged into his 30s and 40s, however, and still failed to find a wife or become the usta (similar to a boss) of his own auto body shop, he no longer could affirm his masculinity with the ease of his youth. This is because standards for masculinity in Egypt shift with age; in youth, men are expected to be free and independent, not tied down to anyone. However as a man ages into his 30s he is expected to begin saving money for an apartment and appliances, all for the purposes of marrying a good wife. To impress the woman he wants to marry, he must have a good physique, a youthful appearance, good money, be mindful of his appearance, etc. This is best accomplished by working in a good, well-paying job, which Samer was unable to do: he was only in school until nine years old, and his family and friends criticized his slowness in building his own workshop, leading him to return to work as a repairman. The long, hard hours of work and resulting poor eating habits aged his body, and also emasculated him because he could not exert full autonomy and power over his work life.</p>
      <p>In one instance of particular interest, a now 40-year-old Samer met with a potential bride for the second time, now wearing his (presumably quite dirty and stained) work clothes. This shows that Samer is operating under two opposing standards of masculinity. He is seeking a bride to be married, meaning he must dress to impress. Women in this area are very picky about their future husbands’ dress standards, since any small detail, even dusty shoes, could indicate miserliness or an inability to afford better clothing. Yet simultaneously, he is a man of 40, and none of his peers (all married) are expected to dress so well. They are all several years’ married now, some with kids in their teens, and if these men were dressing nicely it would actually indicate possible adultury. Samer’s perceived faux pas is in reality an attempt to assert his masculinity in a way he sees his peers do. He wants to fit in with his peers yet in doing so pushes himself away from them even more, since the potential bride immediately rejects him and his work clothes.</p>
      <p>From the two readings, we can see that the assertion of one’s masculinity is at the same time an assertion of class and social network. The supervisors in the factory assert their position over the workers through violence; the workers assert their position alongside each other through violence towards their coworkers. The usta in the auto body shop asserts his position over the young boys training under him through violence. Samer attempts to assert his position as an equal to his peers by gaining a wife and dressing poorly as they do. Though the two articles focus on time periods almost 80 years apart, they both show that masculine identity in Egypt intersects with class in a way that may be otherwise hard to see.</p>
