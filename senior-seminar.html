      <h2>A brief history of Palestine</h2>
      <p>Before we get into it, I want to quickly talk about the history of Palestine. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRYZjOuUnlU">video I have linked here</a> is a wonderful quick explanation of what exactly has happened in the area in the past 100 years or so. While you watch, it is important to remember that this is occurring in an area approximately the size of Vermont. So when you see maps like this one, each of those green areas are extremely tiny.</p>
      <p>I watched a different video recently while writing this, and part of it really stuck with me: if you look at the news about Israel and Palestine, the amount of deaths is heavily skewed towards Palestinians. This is because the United States is pumping vast amounts of money into Israel, which now has one of the best militaries in the world. For this reason, I do not call it a “conflict” between Israel and Palestine, but rather an “occupation”.</p>
